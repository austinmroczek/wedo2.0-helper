# wedo2.0-helper
A bash script to help educators quickly manage Lego Education WeDo 2.0 files generated by students.

wedo_helper

This is the main script.  It attempts to remove any workbooks or project files that accumulate in the WeDo 2.0 app over time.

wedo_cron

This script will set up a cron job to run the main script every day.



Install

$ cd Documents/WeDo/

$ git clone https://github.com/austinmroczek/wedo2.0-helper

The above may ask you to install Xcode command line developer tools.  Do so.

$ cd wedo2.0-helper/

$ chmod 755 wedo_helper wedo_cron

$ ./wedo_cron

This sets up a background task to remove all the files automatically when the computer reboots.

$ ./wedo_helper

This step is only required if you want to remove all the files immediately.
